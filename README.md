# Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization (GANs) Solution

This repository contains my solutions for the Coursera course [Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization (GANs).](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans)

> The DeepLearning.AI Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization provides an exciting introduction to image generation with GANs, charting a path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques through an easy-to-understand approach. It also covers social implications, including bias in ML and the ways to detect it, privacy preservation, and more. Build a comprehensive knowledge base and gain hands-on experience in GANs. Train your own model using PyTorch, use it to create images, and evaluate a variety of advanced GANs.

## Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization (GANs)

The fundamental components of GANs, build a basic GAN using PyTorch, use convolutional layers to build advanced DCGANs that processes images, apply W-Loss function to solve the vanishing gradient problem, and learn how to effectively control your GANs and build conditional GANs.
